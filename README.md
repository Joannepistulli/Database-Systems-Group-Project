## Introduction
Amazon, one of the largest e-commerce platforms, provides a compelling use case to explore how an **Enterprise Data Architecture (EDA)** can be designed to support real-time data insights, data integration, and analytics. This improves decision-making and operational efficiency for both the consumer and the producer.

The focus of this project will be creating **reference models** for structured and unstructured data integration within Amazon’s business model, highlighting key considerations, quality, and security.

## Project Goals
The objective of this project is to design an **EDA** that enables Amazon to integrate diverse data sources. The key goals include:

1. **Real-Time Insights**  
   Semi-real-time data processing to support fast decision-making and enhance customer experience.
   
2. **Data Integration**  
   Integrate structured data such as transactional and customer data with unstructured data such as product reviews to enable comprehensive analysis.
   
3. **Data Governance**  
   Establish a robust governance framework to ensure data quality, metadata management, and compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Methodology

### **Phase 1: Analysis Phase**
- Evaluate Amazon’s existing data landscape, including both structured and unstructured data sources.
- Identify key business needs, reporting requirements, and data quality standards.

### **Phase 2: Design Phase**
- Create a **logical data model** that integrates unstructured data.
- Develop an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to outline data dependencies and relationships.

### **Phase 3: Design of the Operational Data Store (ODS)**
- Translate the logical data model into a **physical data schema**.
- Implement real-time data pipelines.
- Include **data quality checking** mechanisms to ensure consistency and reliability.

### **Phase 4: Reference Architecture**
- Address **data quality** and **metadata management**.
- Prevent data lakes from becoming **data swamps** through governance best practices.

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of this project, we aim to achieve:
- A **scalable** and **robust data architecture**.
- Seamless integration of structured and unstructured data.
- Real-time analytics to support fast and efficient decision-making.
- An **Operational Data Store (ODS)** that centralizes critical data for Amazon’s business operations.
